    <h1>Defanged Horror</h1>
    <p>A collection of questionable films.<p>

    <h2>Critters (1986)</h2>
    <img class="resize-30" src="img/critters.jpg" alt="Critters movie poster">
    <p class="rating">Rating: 5/10</p>
    <p>In <span class="title">Critters</span>, alien bounty hunters hunt and kill tiny
      extraterrestrial cuties that look like bare-face Gene Simmonses.
      With the help of the Brown family, the cuties are defeated and there
      are no consequences. Everyone is fine, except hundreds—possibly
      thousands—of lil' cuties. <span class="inline-rating">5/10 for dead cuties.</p>

      <h2>Jack Frost (1997)</h2>
      <img class="resize-30" src="img/jackfrost.jpg" alt="Jack Frost movie poster">
      <p class="rating">Rating: 2/10</p>
      <p>In 1998, Warner Bros released <span class="title">Jack Frost</span>—a
        family film starring Michael Keaton as a not-great dad who dies in a
        car accident. He's resurrected as a snow man for some reason to make
        amends with his son. This <span class="title">Jack Frost</span> is not
        that film. This film is about a serial killer who turns into a
        radioactive snowman to get revenge on the cop who arrested him. He's
        not successful, but he does murder an entire family as collateral
        damage. <span class="inline-rating">2/10 for snowman with teeth.</p>

      <h2>Vampire's Kiss (1989)</h2>
      <img class="resize-30" src="img/vampires-kiss.jpg" alt="Vampire's Kiss movie poster">
      <p class="rating">Rating: 8/10</p>
      <p>Nic Cage gives the performance of a lifetime in
      <span class="title">Vampire's Kiss</span> as an unhinged New York yuppy
      with a completely indiscernable accent. He shouts the alphabet. He eats
      a live cockroach. He murders a woman using his mouth. He runs
      through lower Manhattan screaming, "I AM A VAMPIRE. I AM
      VAMPIRE. I AM VAMPIRE." At times, he sports a Chigurh cut while arguing
      with Sharon, an imaginary paramore. <span class="inline-rating">7/10
      for peak Nic Cage.</span>
