    <h2>Critters (1986)</h2>
    <p class="rating">Rating: 5/10</p>
    <p>In <span class="movie-title">Critters</span>, alien bounty hunters hunt and kill tiny
    extraterrestrial cuties that look like bare-face Gene Simmonses.
    With the help of the Brown family, the cuties are defeated and there
    are no consequences. Everyone is fine, except hundreds—possibly
    thousands—of lil' cuties. <span class="inline-rating">5/10 for dead cuties.</p></div>

    <h2>Jack Frost (1997)</h2>
    <p class="rating">Rating: 2/10</p>
    <p>In 1998, Warner Bros released <span class="movie-title">Jack Frost</span>—a
    family film starring Michael Keaton as a not-great dad who dies in a
    car accident. He's resurrected as a snow man for some reason to make
    amends with his son. This <span class="movie-title">Jack Frost</span> is not
    that film. This film is about a serial killer who turns into a
    radioactive snowman to get revenge on the cop who arrested him. He's
    not successful, but he does murder an entire family as collateral
    damage. <span class="inline-rating">2/10 for snowman with teeth.</p></div>

    <h2>Uninvited (1988)</h2>
    <p class="rating">Rating: 3/10</p>
    <p>Sometimes people poison cats for science. Sometimes that poison alters
    the cats' genetic information in exactly the right way so that monster cats
    grow inside of them. Sometimes these cats go on cruises to the Caymans with
    several eighties stereotypes and murder everyone onboard by vomiting up the
    monster cats. This is the plot of <span class="movie-title">Uninvited</span>—a
    film in which scantily-clad spring breakers do actually invite a mutant cat
    onto a yacht with a few criminals and millions of dollars.
    <span class="inline-rating">3/10 for screaming kitties.</p></div>

    <h2>Vampire's Kiss (1989)</h2>
    <p class="rating">Rating: 8/10</p>
    <p>Nic Cage gives the performance of a lifetime in
    <span class="movie-title">Vampire's Kiss</span> as an unhinged New York yuppy
    with a totally indiscernable accent. At times, he sports a Chigurh cut
    while arguing with Sharon, an imaginary paramore. He shouts the alphabet.
    He eats a live cockroach. He murders with his mouth. He runs through lower
    Manhattan screaming, "I AM A VAMPIRE. I AM A VAMPIRE. I AM A VAMPIRE."
    He terrorizes an employee over file organization. He laughs, he cries,
    he gags, he lights up even the smallest screen.
    <span class="inline-rating">8/10 for career-peak Nic Cage.</span></div>
