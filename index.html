    <p>Critters is a movie in which alien bounty hunters hunt and kill tiny
      extraterrestrial cuties that look like make-up free Gene Simmonses.
      With the help of the Brown family, the cuties are defeated and there
      are no consequences. Everyone is fine, except hundredsâ€”possibly
      thousands of tiny cuties.</p>
