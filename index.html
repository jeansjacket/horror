    <h1>De-fanged Horror</h1>
    <p>A collection of questionable films.<p>
    <h2>Critters (1986)</h2>

    <p class="rating">Rating: 5/10</p>
    <p>In <span class="title">Critters</span>, alien bounty hunters hunt and kill tiny
      extraterrestrial cuties that look like make-up free Gene Simmonses.
      With the help of the Brown family, the cuties are defeated and there
      are no consequences. Everyone is fine, except hundreds—possibly
      thousands—of lil' cuties. <span class="title">5/10 for dead cuties.</p>

      <h2>Jack Frost (1997)</h2>
      <img class="resize" src="img/jackfrost.jpg" alt="Jack Frost movie poster">
      <p class="rating">Rating: 2/10</p>
      <p>In 1998, Warner Bros released <span class="title">Jack Frost</span>—a
        family film starring Michael Keaton as a not-great dad who dies in a
        car accident. He's resurrected as a snow man for some reason to make
        amends with his son. This <span class="title">Jack Frost</span> is not
        that film. This film is about a serial killer who turns into a
        radioactive snowman to get revenge on the cop who arrested him. He's
        not successful, but he does murder an entire family as collateral
        damage. <span class="title">2/10 for snowman with teeth.</p>
